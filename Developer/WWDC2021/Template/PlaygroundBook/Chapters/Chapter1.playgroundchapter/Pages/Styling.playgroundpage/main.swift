 # Styling with CSS
 Welcome to CSS styling. In the last page, we learnt about the concept of classes and CSS. Now, we will dive into the properties that make up CSS by editing a card that I have already premade for you! The editor at the top is a CSS editor and I have extracted most of the complex CSS and HTML, leaving only the basic properties for you to have fun with. Let's go!

 ### CSS Properties
 There are approximately over 500 CSS properties in modern CSS, But today, we will only be learning a few of the basic ones.

 ### Challenge Time!
 Hmmm that card looks a tad odd... Looks like the styling is off! You'll need to fix up some of the issues in the styling and doing so, you'll learn about a few properties and their usage.
 Instructions (attached in CSS editor itself as well):
 - Class Name: card
     - Change background color to white
 - Class Name: photo
     - Change width to 100px
     - Change border radius to 50%
 - Class Name: text-area
     - Change padding to 40px
 - Class Name: name
     - Change text-decoration from line-through to underline
 - Class Name: subtitle
     - Change font-size to 14px

 ### No Peeking! (unless you're done with the challenge or is having difficulty)
 Here is the correct CSS code:
```
 .card {
   background: white;
   border-radius: 10px;
 }

 .photo {
   width: 100px;
   height: 100px;
   border-radius: 50%;
 }

 .text-area {
   width: 300px;
   padding: 40px;
 }

 .name {
   font-size: 24px;
   text-decoration: underline;
 }

 .subtitle {
   color: #A9A9A9;
   font-size: 14px;
   text-align: center;
 }

 .content {
   color: gray;
   text-align: center;
 }
```
