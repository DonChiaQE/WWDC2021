 # Text tags and Divs
  Text tags and divs are the fundamental building blocks of the web. All HTML tags start with a `<tag>` and end with `</tag>`, it is essential that the slash is used on the ending tag as it tells HTML that the tag has ended.

  ### 1. Text Tags
  Commonly used text tags are `<h1>` `<h2>` `<h3>` `<h4>` `<p>`. H tags are used to denote headers while the p tags represent paragraphs.
  
  ### 2. Divs
  In essence, divs are a short term for division and they are basically containers that hold any HTML tags. Styling can be easily applied to a div through CSS, more on that later. HTML classes will also be featured here as it is essential when making use of divs.
  
  ### 3. Classes
  Classes are declared in HTML tags such that they can be referenced in CSS later on. As seen on screen, the current div I have created for you is tagged with a class tag of 'biography'. The class is then referenced in the CSS by `.biography`.
 
 ### Challenge Time!
 In the stickies is some content about myself, name, country of birth and some interesting facts about me! You'll need to present the texts within the biography div by following the instructions below. I have done name as an example for you.
 Instructions:
 - Country
     - Use a `<h2>` tag
 - Facts
     - Enclose all content within a `<p>` tag.
 
 ### No Peeking! (unless you're done with the challenge or is having difficulty)
 ```
 <div class="biography">
     <h1>Don</h1>
     <h2>Singapore</h2>
     <p>My first contact with Apple product was a 5th generation iPod that belonged to my Father. We've owned iPhones since the iPhone 3G and being a computing science student, I use a powerful MacBook Pro with the newest M1 as the power allows for me to work swiftly (pun intended). The MacBook coupled with tools like Xcode allows me to power through my iOS development journey.</p>
 </div>
