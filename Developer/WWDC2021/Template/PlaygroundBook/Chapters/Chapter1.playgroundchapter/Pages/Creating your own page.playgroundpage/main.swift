 # Creating Your Own Page (optional)
 Congratulations! You've made it to the end! You now get a chance to create your own page with HTML and CSS. It wouldn't be much but it will give you a taste of how the frontend of the web works. I have provided a simple template for you to start with as well as the CSS properties you have already come across.

 ### Add Some Content
 Add some content to your page through the left HTML editor! I have divided the page into three separate containers (divs), title, details and biography. Go ahead and use title tags you have learnt in the title div. Proceed to add some details and biography about yourself using paragraph or any formatting tags you know!

 ### Now Style It!
 In the right CSS editor, I have already created the necessary classes and a few properties you should be familiar with. Go ahead and edit them as you please!

 ### Thank You!
 I hope you've learnt something new with this short experience. There is much more to come with regards to web development. If you're still here and want to continue your journey, do read up on layouts using flexbox and a few other CSS properties, that's how the card in the styling page was built!
